== Description ==
**Send Posts to Subscribers** is a powerful yet simple plugin that lets you build an email subscriber list using **Gravity Forms** and automatically send email notifications when new posts are published. Whether posts are manually created in WordPress or generated by external applications (such as **NotesRSS.com**), this plugin ensures subscribers stay updated.

= Features =
* Collects subscribers via **Gravity Forms**.
* Sends **automated post email notifications**.
* Prevents duplicate emails when posts are updated multiple times.
* Includes **Unsubscribe Form** support.
* Works with **SMTP plugins** for better email delivery.
* Compatible with posts generated manually or through external services like **NotesRSS.com**.

== Installation ==
1. Download and install via the WordPress Plugin Repository.
2. Activate the plugin in **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.
3. Create two **Gravity Forms**:
    - **Subscribers Form** (Form ID 1)
        - Add an **Email Field** (Field ID 1).
    - **Unsubscribe Form** (Form ID 2)
        - Add an **Email Field** (Field ID 2) for users to opt out.
4. Configure the plugin under **Settings > Email Subscribers**:
    - Enter the **Form IDs** and **Field IDs**.
    - Set the **From Email Address** for SMTP.
5. The plugin will automatically email active subscribers when a new post is published.

== Usage ==
= Manually Created Posts =  
Users can create posts through the **WordPress Post Editor**. When a post is published, all **active subscribers** receive an email notification with a link to the post.

= Auto-Generated Posts (NotesRSS.com & Other Services) =  
The plugin can send email notifications for posts created by **external applications** that generate WordPress posts via **REST API or automation tools**. Any new postâ€”whether created manually or by an external serviceâ€”will trigger an email to subscribers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I customize the email content? =  
You can modify the email subject and message template in the plugin settings or extend the function with WordPress filters.

= Can I manually remove subscribers? =  
Yes! You can deactivate subscribers from the database or by having them submit the **Unsubscribe Form**.
